# WeatherWave 🌊🌞

WeatherWave is a simple TypeScript web application that provides weather information. It fetches data from the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) to display current weather, wind speed, humidity, and sunrise/sunset times based on the user's location.

This is my first project, and there might be some mistakes, but I hope you find it useful! 😊
